# OceansElevenDVDDemo

I created the original Ocean's Eleven DVD menu demo in Silverlight back in 2010 to demonstrate that XAML could create layered, complex animations, and still run smoothly.  This is a UWP port of that project.  

Back then I used Microsoft Expression Studio to complete the project.  I used Expression Design to create all the bitmap assets and vector paths.  I used Expression Encoder to create the .wmv and .wma files and to grab the frame captures I used to fill the number assets.  Finally, I used Expression Blend to put it all together.

I paid very close attention to detail.  You may notice that all the "1" assets are slightly different from each other, just like in the actual Ocean's Eleven DVD menu.  The animation timing is also very close to the original.

When I couldn't find some screen grabs the actual DVD menu used for the number fills, I created my own from frame captures.
